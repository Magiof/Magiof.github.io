# Nemo-with-me🟪

<br>

### For those who don't want to be alone! Concentrate with others!

<br>

An exchange space where you can leave your own trace and others can share it! If you feel like someone is watching you, you can do better! If you show interest in each other, you can focus more and work harder!

<br>
<br>

## **Features**
<br>
<br>

⏱ **Shared Timer**

 - We have implemented a shared timer feature that allows users to focus together for a set amount of time when performing tasks that require a time limit.
 <br>
 <br>
 - Examples of tasks that require a time limit include studying, exercising, sketching, playing mafia games, and more.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

👥 **Real-time video chat**

 - With the microphone on/off and camera on/off functions, users of the video chat can choose to use them freely, and can also exchange simple emotional expressions by pressing emoticons.

📊 **Record Graph**

 - To visually represent how much a user has been active on "Nemo with me" service, we designed the my page as a graph. 
 <br>
 <br>
 - In the daily and weekly participation records, users can check their participation records by category, and in the monthly participation record, they can see the total daily participation time.
 <br>
 <br>
 - We also added badges to allow users to feel a sense of accomplishment while using the service and implemented the ability to set their preferred representative badges to show other participants.
